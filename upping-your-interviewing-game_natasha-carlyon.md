## Notes
### The Ideal Team Player
- Book by Patrick Lencioni that she uses as a framework for hiring people and interview philosophy
- Three virtues:
  - Humble
    - "Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it is thinking of yourself less." - C.S Lewis
    - Someone who says "I'm really bad at that" or "That's something I can't do" isn't exactly humble ?
  - Hungry
    - "Hungry people almost never have to be pushed by a manager to work harder because they are self-motivated and diligent."
    - They are able to work at a manageable AND sustainable pace
      - Not burning themselves out working nights and weekends
  - Smart
    - Called "People Smart" because it doesn't necessarily mean intelligence
    - "Smart simply refers to a person's common sense about people."
    - It isn't quite emotional intelligence, but rather about common sense - really being able to interact with others.

- 0 for 3
  - A candidate like this is someone that has none of these virtues. It isn't hard to spot these people
- 1 for 3
  - Someone who is strong in only one area
  - Someone who is Humble Only is called a "pawn"
    - These people are kind to others and are scared of conflict
    - If you are a company that never has disagreements, that's a red flag
  - Someone who is Hungry Only is called a "bulldozer"
    - They like doing work, but only work that they care about.
    - These kind of people can last a long time at a company that only cares about producing results
  - Someone who is People Smart Only are called "charmers"
    - These people are entertaining, hilarious, and get along with everyone, but they don't do much work.
    - These people can last a while at a company because people like them
- 2 for 3
  - People who are humble and hungry are called "accidental mess makers"
    - They really care about doing work and are humble, but they have problems forming relationships with colleagues
  - People who are humble and people smart are called the "lovable slacker"
    - People who do just enough work to get by, but they are lovable so they get by
  - People who are hungry and people smart are called the "skillful politicians"
    - These kind of people don't really care about others and don't have much humility, but they are good at portraying themselves as humble. They can be the most dangerous

### The Interview Process
- From the perspective of The Greater Sum
- Video Interview
  - Typically about 30 minutes, gives a superficial look at the candidate
  - Asking questions to see if they are humble, hungry, and people smart.
- Fist-to-five
  - Voting on the candidate, on a scale from 0-5
- Debrief
  - What is their strongest virtue? What is their weakest virtue? What are their strengths? Weaknesses? etc.
  - Vote again multiple times
- Invite candidate for lunch
  - Very unstructured, informal environment. Lowers the candidate's guard and lets them get to know the candidate a bit more on a personal level
- Debrief
  - Bring the candidate back to the office and let them know what's going on.
  - Have a small discussion in a separate room
- Short Q&A
  - Depends on the candidate - have a really good idea on where they are in the three virtues so this step is skipped. If there are any concerns, this is intended to address them
- Debrief
  - Talk about the results of the Q&A
- Coding Exercise
  - Pair program with the individual and they are actually coding something on the computer. Let them code in any language they want.
- Debrief
- Reflect

### Example questions
- Hungry
  - What is the hardest you've ever worked on something in your life?
  - Why do you want to work for us?
  - What is the most interesting project you've worked on?
  - Where do you see yourself in five years?
  - What are you doing for professional development?
  - Red flags:
    - Gives very generic answers
    - History of giving up
    - Lack of enthusiasm
  - Scare people with sincerity
- Humble
  - Describe your current team. What do you like and dislike?
  - What are the most important accomplishments of your career?
  - What was the most embarrasing moment in your career? Or the biggest failure?
  - How did you hand;e that embarrassment or failure?
  - How do you handle apologies, either giving or accepting them?
  - Red flags:
    - Brags
    - Does not seem to share credit with others
    - Treats others with disrespect
  - What's your greatest strength? What is your greatest area of improvement?
  - How do they treat others? Waitresses, administrators, etc.
- People Smart
  - What do you do that others in your personal life might find annoying?
  - What kind of people annoy you the most, and how do you deal with them?
  - Have you ever worked with a difficult colleague or boss? How did you handle the situation?
  - Red flags:
    - Body language
    - Has trouble articulating
  - How would you describe your personality?

### Other tips
- Ask questions more than once later in the interview process to verify consistency
- Properly explore hunches
  - Sometimes you think the person might be lacking in one of the virtues, but you're not quite sure.
- Rephrase a question as "What would your friends/colleagues say about...?"

### Unconscious Bias
- The truth is that all of us are biased in some way or some form. You can be biased in many different ways:
  - Race
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Location
  - Background
  - Religion
  - Family
  - and so on...
- People are more likely to hire people like them.
  - More diverse teams tend to do better than teams that are homogenous
- **Take the Harvard Implicit Bias test**
- How do we fight the unconscious bias?
  - Blind Auditions
    - strip the person's name or other identifying information from resumes

## Key Takeaways
- Implicit and unconscious biases are real and you should do something to be aware of them to be a better interviewer
- Harvard Implicit Bias tests are very interesting and a good way to discover your unconscious biases
- A different form of tech interview - they pair program with the candidate for an hour or so. They give them a prompt and let them use whatever language they want to accomplish what they're trying to do, but they're actually doing pair programming.
