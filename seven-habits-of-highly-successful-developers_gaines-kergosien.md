* missed 10 minutes of this talk because of the long keynote
### 2. Assess your skills - the soft ones
- communication skills
- teamwork and collaboration
- adaptability and growth
- Problem solving skills
  - This can come out in an interview when you're asking about how someone solved a problem. It's not about the problem itself, but how you overcame it
- Critical observation
  - ex: someone gives you a report to generate and you give them exactly what they asked for, but the end product wasn't exactly what they wanted. You can be a more integral part of the problem solving portion of moving forward and fixing the issues
  - Anyone who exhibits a critical observation skill should be given more visibility into what you're doing to help address things you don't even know are problems
- Conflict resolution
  - Being able to appropriately respond to conflict and help to resolve it
- Leadership skills
- Time management skills

### 3. Set goals
- set some goals of what you want to achieve.
  - What do you want to do in your career? Your life?
- Set goals that motivate you
- set SMART goals
  - specific
  - measurable
  - attainable
  - relevant
  - time-based
- Make an action plan
  - this includes routines to make sure you are doing something associated with the goal.
  - I want to make sure I do at least one thing to move towards this goal. Every day I walk into my home office, I am going to do X.
- The daily planner
  - paper planners - why would I want to write things down when I have all of these cool apps to manage them?
    - have goals visible while you look at daily plans
  - getting things done method

### 4. Build your brand
- We aren't necessarily talking about brands that a company have
- Everyone has a brand even if you think you don't. If you don't have one you created, you've probably inherited one.
- I don't want to put myself in a situation where I am expected to have skills that I *don't* have.
- Blogging is a good way to build a brand
  - you are not a unique flower. There is always someone else who has faced the same challenge
  - problems = opportunities
    - every problem you face is an opportunity to share more info about it
  - Start discussions
    - talk about problems you face to start conversations with others
  - embrace controversy
    - take a stand on some things that are controversial as long as you can back up your position
  - Solicit feedback
    - getting peoples' perspective on things you have created
    - If you've built something that was difficult to figure out, you can show it off but also ask for feedback and see if there was a better way to go about solving things
- Speaking is another good way to do this
  - tell a story
  - open spaces
    - a discussion-based format where no one is a presenter, but instead you have conversations about certain topics
  - Company lunch-and-learns
    - take an hour or however long and share what you learned at a conference. That gives way more value than just sending someone that pays no attention
  - Contact local user group leaders
  - Conference call for speakers

### 5. Connect with peers
- In person
  - discover passions and pains
    - ask "what are you passionate about?" instead of "what do you do?"
    - Create a really meaningful connection with them instead of small talk
  - Follow up!
    - follow up via email and give some connection to what you talked about
    - If you reconnect later, you can figure out where you know that person from.
  - Feed people
    - There is a tribal instinct that says "if you sit down and share food with someone, you belong to the same group."
    - It sounds weird, but our subconscious is not really rational
  - Take interest in projects
    - ask for more detail about projects they talk about
  - Seek opportunities to help
    - the more I connect with people, the more people I know that can help with the passions and pains someone may have
  - sample questions
    - What have you been working on lately?
    - What do you like best about your work?
- Online
  - LinkedIn
  - Twitter
  - Facebook
  - Tripit

### 6. Be your own salesperson
- At some point you're gonna have to promote yourself
- Announce events
  - Twitter
  - Blog
- Encourage others
- Resume
- Business cards
  - plan ahead
  - simplicity stands out
    - name
    - email
    - phone number
    - website
  - White space is useful
    - have a section where you can jot down what the personal connection is before you give it to someone
- Interviewing
  - be prepared
    - company objectives and news
    - informed questions for interviewer
    - know their ideal candidate
  - success stories
    - talk about things that you were successful in that highlight skills that you have
