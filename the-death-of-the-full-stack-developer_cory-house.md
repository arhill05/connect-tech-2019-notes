## By Cory House

- Full stack in...
  - 2000
    - Need to Know:
      - Linux
      - Apache
      - MySQL
      - PHP
      - HTML
      - CSS
    - Typical shop
      - No source control
      - no client side
      - etc...
  - 2020
    - Literally dozens of things under different categories
    - It's not even a comprehensive list. It's an onion. You could peel back one layer of any of the items and have so many more layers to each item

- What if I decided to stop trying to do it all and instead decide to go pro?
- Going pro is not about appearances. Going pro is about **FOCUS**.
- Who comes to mind when you think about a professional?
  - Serena Williams made a career out of being amazingly good at Tennis
  - I think about Steve Martin who is a great stand-up comedian. From telling jokes to chairs in an empty bar to filling up NFL stadiums
  - Steven King - the first person that comes to mind about scary books
  - Carlos Santana - the first person that comes to mind about playing guitar
- What does any of this have to do with software? Everything.
- Who is famous in the software industry?
  - Bob Martin - Clean Code
  - Martin Fowler - Refactoring and Taxonomy
- Who else?
  - MAtthew Renze is known for Data Science
  - Julie Lerman is known for Entity Framework
  - Marcy Sutton is known for Accessibillity
  - Troy Hunt is known for Security
  - If you go to any of the blogs for these people, you'll know that they have a particular set of skills

Want to be famous*? **Specialize**
- *to the small group you serve (the best type of fame)

Example: Giordanos vs Costco
- When you have a conversation of where to go for pizza, you don't think Costco. Not because their pizza is bad, but because their focus isn't pizza.

## The famous aren't known for width **because they don't need width**
- Stay busy with one specialty. You'll have plenty of work to do.
- Misconception: Wider = more opportunities
- Reality: Narrower = more opportunities

## What would people Google for to find me?
- They won't Google "Software developer in Atlanta."

## Take advice from a woodpecker
- A woodpecker pecks on average 20,000 times on a single tree in a single spot to be able to get to a meal
- If a woodpecker went around and pecked 1,000 times on multiple different trees, they'd die of starvation.

## One question that you should answer today:
- I want to be exceptional at _______.
  - If you can't answer this quickly, then neither can anyone else.
- A good book on this:
  - Essentialism

## "If you want to be an anomaly, you've got to act like one." - Gary Vaynerchuk
- If I want to be an anomaly, I have to have the discipline to stay on top of it. Otherwise, people won't give me money if I'm not adding value.

## Specialization becomes a necessity as industries mature.

# Executing Focus
- You cannot change only one thing
- Several different facets of life:
  - Family
  - Job
  - Religion
  - Etc

- If you're doing something that isn't productive or pleasurable, just STOP.
- "It's either 'HELL YEAH' or 'no.'" - Derek Sivers

- **Show focus in public**
  - You have to show what you do publicly. Twitter is a good example - show what you do, exclusively what you do - on Twitter.

## It's not about ego. It's about opportunity.
- Increase your luck surface area
  - Attend conferences
  - Speak
  - Don't eat alone
  - Blog

## Be remarkable

## Key Takeaways
- Focusing on specialization instead of being able to do everything is the best way to move forward
- Being famous for a niche brings you more business and makes you more successful
- Know a few things and know them well - don't try to do everything
