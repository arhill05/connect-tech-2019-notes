## Notes
- You don't need a PhD to do machine learning - you just need to be curious

### Real-time Traffic Forecasts
- Uses a combo of time, distance traveled, and indivudual events as data sets
- Sequence model accounts for each anticipated stop or reduction in speed
- Google is taking these things a step further to predict real-time bus travel time estimates with Google Maps

### Machine Learning + Social Media?
- tons of data from social media
  - Keywords and tags
  - frequency of keyword mentions
  - Sentiment analysis
    - What do these keywords mean? Are they positive? Negative?

### Machine Learning is not the future, but right now
- there are tons of different mainstream things that are using ML. It is here *today*

### Why democratize ML?
- If you want to build something completely new, you can do it with ML
- A wider range of perspectives create more universally useful solutions
- If you don't influence the world, the world will influence you
- The idea of trusting data and algorithms more than our own judgement has its pros and cons

### ML has big ethical implications
- if not everyone is involved in ML, then the people who are involved will write the future of it
- We have to be careful when giving algorithms data and producing conclusions based on the models

### Breaking down ML - AI vs ML vs Deep Learning
- Artificial Intelligence
  - A machine completes a task based on a set of algorithms.
- Machine Learning
  - A subset of AI - a method of training algorithms such that they can learn how to make decisions
- Deep learning
  - A subset of ML - just like we use our brains to identify patterns, deep learning can be taught in the same way

### Traditional programming vs ML
- Traditional programming a programmer takes inputs, and writes rules to get outputs
- Machine learning takes a bunch of answers (outputs) and inputs, and then spits out the rules

### When to use ML
- A pattern must exist. If the distribution is truly random, then ML will not be able to help.
- The pattern can not be defined mathematically, at least, not yet. If it were, we could simply write a program to do what we want to do. It wouldn't give us the same kind of accuracy we get as writing it ourselves
- The data must exist

### Challenges from a first real-world ML product at SalesLoft
- Initial dataset was too noisy - too many names for the same role/seniority
- Viewpoint differences between data-science and prod-engineering
  - Data science team uses Python, SalesLoft platform uses Ruby/Elixir
  - Ideation not concerned with edge cases; QA very concerned
    - QA wants to test edge cases everywhere, but ideation didn't care about them
- Labeling dataset took days
- Making sure we were building the right thing for our customers use cases
  - ...instead of building something we thought was cool because we were excited about ML

### How to democratize ML?
- demystify
  - correct the myth that you need a PhD to do it
  - Get everyone familiar with what it is
- remove known obstacles
  -
- share tools
- evolve skill sets
  - You can use your existing skills as a web developer or whatever you do

### Getting started with ML
- Foundation - get a handle on foundational concepts
- Open source - great way to get exposure and experience working with ML
- Community - attend community events and talks

## Key Takeaways
- ML can be good if used when it makes sense
- We should democratize machine learning to get everyone involved
- how to get started with ML
